# Idle Index Template
A chrome extension for displaying artist screensavers.

We recognise there is a wider interest in the use of screensavers as a space for creative artistic expression and investigation.

Idle Index is a series commissioned by Phoenix, working with Leicester-connected artists to explore themes of online/digital idleness.

The series was initially published using dedicated screensaver software. This has been increasingly awkward, and prohibitively costly to use.

Hoping to refresh the engagement with the medium we have developed and published the latest series as a browser extension. It is available for Chrome. Taking the browser page as the element that monitors idleness and activity, opened up new possibilities.

The repository here includes a template version that you can populate and publish with your own artist screensavers.
